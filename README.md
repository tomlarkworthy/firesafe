# Firesafe
by Tom Larkworthy

Firesafe is a technology to enforce data integrity, and enable complex transactions, on Firebase.

Firesafe compiles hierarchical state machines (HSM) definitions into Firebase security rules. The Firesafe HSM language is expressive, and a super set of the Firebase security language. Adding consistent, concurrent and fail safe protocols to Firebase is now a whole lot simpler (e.g. cross-tree transactions).

Firebase is already the future of databases, offering scalable low latency database-as-a-service. Firesafe compliments this amazing technology with an expressive syntax to get the most out of its security model. (Firesafe is not endorsed by Firebase). Development of secure protocols in Firesafe is supported by a static analyser (see https://github.com/tomlarkworthy/firesafe/wiki/Send-Item)

## Motivation

In multiplayer apps/games, people cheat. It's a loss of direct sales, AND the free loaders also diminish the fun for everyone else. Multiplayer games are web-scale, which means the old solutions to data integrity and transactions don't work (e.g. SQL).

Firebase solved one problem of the cost of providing low latency persistent data storage to mobile and desktop games. It's the first scalable NoSQL hosted solution that didn't suck. It also provided an unorthodox security and transactions abstraction. Turns out that abstraction has enough purchase to do some really cool things not possible in many NoSQL environments. Unfortunately, properly configuring the security layer is extremely verbose and error prone.

Proper data integrity is very important, especially when users have *something to gain*. A classic game exploit is the "item clone". In this exploit, a player gives an item to a friend, and yanks their connection to the game. Now, the player and the friend have the item. Various variations exist, some not even requiring a friend.

The reason why many games are affected by the same type of bug is that a difficult technical issue lies behind the exploit. It is very had to enforce the semantics of a **cross user transaction**.

Firebase *can* solve this with a **two phase commit protocol**. Classic literature on 2 phase commits state it *can* become deadlocked. However, normal deadlock issues don't arise in this case, because Firebase is a central authority, and client's states are persisted on disconnect. Unfortunately, actually writing a two phase commit protocol in Firebase security rules is actually really hard and error prone, and the 2-phase commit protocol was one motivation for creating the Firesafe abstraction of Hierarchical State Machines (HSM) in Firebase.

However, while HSM will prevent silly mistakes, it still can't prevent high level protocol errors. We have connected Firesafe to a theorem prover which allows **proveing non-blocking properties and protocol invariants for arbitrary HSMs**. Our long term goal is to make **"provably secure, deadlock free, multi-user interactions"** simple.


#The HSM Language

In Firesafe we provide the Hierarchical State Machines (HSM) language. A similar language (UML statecharts) is often used in protocol design. A machine is a set of states and a set of transitions between them. Each machine gets compiled down to a single, massive ".write" rule.

The language has a very natural graphical representation. To explain the language let's start with simple examples and build up to a two phase commit protocol for secure exchange of items between players.

## Simple Example: Shop

One common source of complaints and support headaches is buying items in-game. If it goes wrong players could lose currency, or, if it's exploitable, cheaters profit and devalue the currency. This is an acute problem if the currency is bought with real world money.

![send_item_lhs_picture](/doc/shop.png)

In a normal Firebase setting user accounts are represented as wild card ($user) children of "users". By placing our state machine as a child of "$user", Firesafe will generate an state (and signal) variable as a child of any "$user" nodes.

We create secure Firesafe variables: gold, swords and water, at the same hierarchical level as the state machine. This indicates those variables values are protected by Firesafe. They can only ever be tampered with by a connected client *if* explicitly mentioned in a "guard" of "effect" clause of the machine.

In the shopping scenario a user has just a single state, "playing". New players won't have Firebase data initially, so the black circle represents the initialization. New clients cannot initialize their new user accounts to anything though (a source of cheating). **Effect clauses denote post conditions of Firesafe variables, which must evaluate to true**. **Any Firesafe variable not mentioned in an effect is locked**. Guard and effect clauses are expressed as normal Firebase security expressions. In the shop case, the diagram forces clients to initialise their accounts with:

```
{
    state:"playing",
    gold:100,
    swords:0,
    water:0
}
```

Once a player is playing, they have two options in the shop, buying a sword or water. Both these transition are labelled, which indicated the client must state which signal they are using. In this example we use a guard to ensure the player has enough gold to make a purchase and they do not exceed a maximum for the items (max(swords) 2, max(water) 20).

**Guard clauses (diamond) prevent transitions unless the guard evaluates to true**. The guard in the shop ensure the player has the money and space in their inventory. So to buy a sword after initialization when the user has 100 gold and 0 swords, the new player can update
```
{
    signal:"BUY_SWORD",
    gold:90,
    swords:1
}
```
on their "/user/<username>" Firebase reference. The player *cannot* sneak in an update to "water" at the same time, as Firebase enforces no variable mentioned outside the effect clause can change.

The final diagrammatic feature worth mentioning is the unattached red arrow. Unattached arrows on a digram denote a *transition role*. **Transitions only occur if their role clause evaluates to true, which commonly is used to express permissions**. In the shop we only allow the owner of the user record to invoke transitions. The transition role in particular is an excellent building block for complex multi-user interactions, because you can easily express that some transitions can only be performed by certain user roles.

# Example: Item Trade

Sending items from one player to another is problematic in many games and applications. Firebase natively does not offer much help, as Firebase transactions occur only on a subtree. To exchange items across users, you need to transfer data between different data trees (a **cross-tree transaction**). Firebase's atomic transactions cannot express this case, so the trade must be broken down into several smaller transactions that Firebase does support.

One background issue is that a user might disconnect at any time (possible deliberately). One player disconnecting should not trap the other player in an unescapable state (a.k.a. **deadlock**).

A cross tree transaction should either 1. occur, or 2. error and rollback. For a trade, an important invariant is the total number of objects in the world does not change. Drawing inspiration from existing literature, we adapt a **2-phase commit protocol** using in the banking sector for distributed balance trades, to implement trades in Firebase.

Each user is either IDLE, sending an item (TX) or receiving an item (RX). Furthermore, the one partner in the trade must acknowledge the other's actions in a 2-phase commit, so some additional acknowledgement states are required (ACK_RX, ACK_TX).

The complete protocol is described step-by-step in the wiki (https://github.com/tomlarkworthy/firesafe/wiki/Send-Item). The final version in diagram form is as follows:

# Example: Hierarchical State Machines

So far the machines discussed are flat. If you have ever tried to use a finite state machine in a real world setting you might have found yourself replicating arrows until your diagram is an unmanageable mess. Finite state machines suffer from *state space explosion*. Nesting states addresses this issue by reusing transitions via an inheritance-like mechanism.

Miro Samek in the book *"Practical UML Statecharts for C/C++"* explains how to use state nesting, and explains common "patterns" for scalable state machine application. Slide 18 onwards of this online presentation explains in brief why HSMs are so much better than FSMs: http://www.slideshare.net/quantum-leaps/qp-qm-overviewnotes

Note our HSMs do not map directly onto UML statecharts. In particular, UML statecharts are deterministic, whereas Firesafe's are not. In our HSM implementation, you do not need to specify signals at all, and can therefore leave the behaviour of the state chart ambiguous. While the behaviour of firesafe is ambiguous server side, the client still has to explicitly decide which states to move into. The client logic is often not modelable by state machines. Hence, non-deterministic hierarchical state machines are a better formalism for modeling server side data integrity than the deterministic formalism. That said, much of Miro's material is applicable to Firesafe's formalism, and the *"Practical UML Statecharts for C/C++"* book is a thoroughly recommended resource (Note: we are not in any way endorsed by either Miro Samek or Quantum Leaps, LLC, we just love their software!).
